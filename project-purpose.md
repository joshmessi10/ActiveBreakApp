## 🔄 Current Stage of Implementation

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Application Foundation**

   - Electron app structure with proper ES module configuration
   - Multi-page navigation system (Home, Stats, Settings)
   - Responsive dark-themed UI with modern design
   - Application can successfully launch and run

2. **User Interface** ✨ _POLISHED_

   - Complete HTML structure for all three views
   - Professional styling with Inter font family
   - Icon-based navigation using Feather Icons
   - CSS variable design system with refined dark theme
   - Smooth micro-interactions and hover effects
   - Gradient backgrounds and shadow depth hierarchy
   - Video feed container (640x360, 16:9 aspect ratio)

3. **Basic Camera Integration**

   - Camera access request and initialization
   - Video stream rendering to HTML5 video element
   - Error handling for camera access failures
   - Status feedback to user

4. **AI/Computer Vision Core** ✨

   - MoveNet Lightning model integration (TensorFlow.js)
   - Real-time pose landmark detection (17 keypoints)
   - Military-grade posture classification algorithm with 3 strict rules:
     - Rule 1: Perfect horizontal alignment (15% tolerance)
     - Rule 2: Strict vertical alignment (50% height requirement)
     - Rule 3: Level shoulders (10% symmetry tolerance)
   - Intelligent feedback system (specific correction messages)
   - Professional skeleton overlay rendering on canvas
   - Continuous inference loop with requestAnimationFrame

5. **Desktop Notification System** 🚧 **BROKEN - REQUIRES FIX (Triple IPC Bug)**

   - Secure IPC bridge between renderer and main process (implemented but misconfigured)
   - 3-second bad posture threshold detection logic (coded and working)
   - Native OS notifications with sound (main.js ready, but IPC channels don't connect)
   - Smart notification logic (prevents spam, auto-resets) - coded but unreachable due to IPC bug
   - Real-time posture feedback with color coding (visual feedback works, notifications don't)
   - **⚠️ CRITICAL BUG - TRIPLE MISMATCH**: IPC system has 3 simultaneous errors:
     1. **Method Name**: `script.js` calls `window.api.sendNotification()` (doesn't exist), `preload.js` exposes `window.api.notify()`
     2. **Channel**: `preload.js` uses `"notify"`, `main.js` listens to `"notify:posture"`
     3. **Mechanism**: `preload.js` uses `ipcRenderer.invoke()` (async), `main.js` uses `ipcMain.on()` (sync)
   - **Impact**: Notifications never reach the main process
   - **Files Affected**: `script.js` (lines 229, 315), `preload.js` (line 5), `main.js` (line 26)
   - **Status**: Requires coordinated fixes in 3 files (align method names + channels + invoke/on mechanisms)

6. **Data Persistence System** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL (Non-Persistent Across Sessions)**

   - localStorage implementation for posture time tracking (✅ works during session)
   - Real-time data collection (every 1 second) (✅ works)
   - Separate tracking for correct vs. incorrect posture time (✅ works)
   - Statistics dashboard with mm:ss time format display (✅ works)
   - **⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE**: Data does **NOT** persist across app restarts
     - `script.js` lines 459-468 contain a `resetSession()` function that runs on every app start
     - This function **wipes ALL statistics**: `correctSeconds`, `incorrectSeconds`, `alertsCount`, `postureHistory`, `alertsHistory`
     - Users cannot track progress across sessions
     - This behavior is **intentional code** (has Spanish comment explaining it)
     - But **contradicts** earlier documentation claims of persistence
   - **Code Evidence**:
     ```javascript
     // ===== Reset de sesión al iniciar la app (cada ejecución empieza en cero)
     (function resetSession() {
       localStorage.setItem("correctSeconds", "0");
       localStorage.setItem("incorrectSeconds", "0");
       localStorage.setItem("alertsCount", "0");
       localStorage.setItem("postureHistory", "[]");
       localStorage.setItem("alertsHistory", "[]");
     })();
     ```
   - **Status**: Intentional behavior, but should be optional (add setting or remove)

7. **Settings & Configuration System** ✨

   - Fully functional settings page with localStorage persistence
   - Configurable sensitivity (1-10 scale, maps to AI confidence)
   - Toggle notifications on/off
   - Adjustable alert threshold (1-60 seconds)
   - Configurable break interval (5-120 minutes)
   - Automatic break reminders with smart spam prevention

8. **Historical Event Logging** ✨ _NEW_

   - Automatic logging of every posture state change
   - Timestamp-based event records (date + time)
   - Persistent storage in localStorage (capped at 100 events)
   - Interactive history table on statistics page

   - Events sorted newest-first

9. **Supporting Features**

   - Session timer with mm:ss formatting (auto-starts with detection)
   - Interactive statistics dashboard with real data
   - Break reminder system with configurable intervals
   - Complete posture event history with timestamps

10. **UI/UX Polish & Design System** ✨ _NEW_

    - Inter font family with multiple weights (300-700)
    - Feather Icons for clean, modern iconography
    - Comprehensive CSS variable system (20+ variables)
    - Refined color palette with semantic naming
    - Consistent spacing scale (xs → xl)
    - Border-radius and shadow hierarchies
    - Smooth transitions on all interactive elements
    - Micro-interactions (hover lifts, button presses)
    - Icon-only navigation with tooltips
    - Gradient backgrounds on stat cards
    - Professional focus states with subtle glows

11. **User Authentication System (Mockup)** ✨ _NEW_
    - Landing page with Admin/Client routing
    - Admin authentication flow (login, register, dashboard)
    - Client authentication flow (login, register, ready screen)
    - In-memory authentication logic (no backend/database)
    - UI-only implementation for user flow demonstration
    - Separate folder structure for admin and client areas

## 🎯 Next Steps for Development

### 🚨 **Priority 0: CRITICAL BUG FIXES** - **MUST FIX FIRST**

1. ❌ **Fix IPC Notification System** (BREAKING BUG - Triple Mismatch):

   **Problem Analysis**:

   - **Mismatch 1 - Method Names**:
     - `script.js` calls: `window.api.sendNotification()` (doesn't exist)
     - `preload.js` exposes: `window.api.notify()` (different name)
   - **Mismatch 2 - IPC Channels**:
     - `preload.js` sends to: `"notify"`
     - `main.js` listens on: `"notify:posture"` (different channel)
   - **Mismatch 3 - IPC Mechanisms**:
     - `preload.js` uses: `ipcRenderer.invoke()` (async, returns promise)
     - `main.js` uses: `ipcMain.on()` (sync event listener)

   **Fix Options**:

   **Option A** - Simplest (align to sync pattern):

   ```javascript
   // preload.js line 5 - Change to:
   sendNotification: (message) => ipcRenderer.send("notify:posture", message)

   // script.js lines 229, 315 - Keep as:
   window.api.sendNotification("message")

   // main.js line 26 - Keep as:
   ipcMain.on("notify:posture", (event, message) => {...})
   ```

   **Option B** - Align to async pattern:

   ```javascript
   // script.js lines 229, 315 - Change to:
   window.api.notify("message")

   // preload.js line 5 - Keep as:
   notify: (message) => ipcRenderer.invoke("notify", message)

   // main.js line 26 - Change to:
   ipcMain.handle("notify", async (event, message) => {...})
   ```

   **Recommendation**: Use Option A (sync pattern with `send`/`on`) for simplicity

2. ❌ **Fix Data Persistence** (CRITICAL UX ISSUE):

   **Current Behavior**: `resetSession()` function in `script.js` (lines 459-468) wipes ALL data on every app start

   **Fix Options**:

   - **Option A**: Remove `resetSession()` entirely (allow accumulation across sessions)
   - **Option B**: Add a "Clear Stats" button in settings (user control)
   - **Option C**: Add a setting to toggle auto-reset behavior

   **Recommendation**: Option A (remove) or Option C (make optional with setting)

## 🌟 Success Criteria

The project will be considered successfully implemented when:

- ✅ Real-time pose detection accurately identifies user posture
- ❌ Users receive timely alerts for poor posture (**IPC broken - not working**)
- ⚠️ Statistics accurately reflect actual usage patterns (**only during current session, resets on restart**)
- ✅ The application runs smoothly without impacting system performance
- ✅ Settings persist across application restarts
- ✅ Professional UI/UX with polished design and interactions
- ❌ The app can be packaged and distributed to end users

### Current Status Assessment

**What Works (✅ Verified by Line-by-Line Audit)**:

- ✅ AI posture detection with military-grade classification (3 rules: 15%, 50%, 10%)
- ✅ Visual feedback and skeleton overlay (17 keypoints)
- ✅ Settings management with persistence (4 settings, all functional)
- ✅ Statistics tracking during active session (correctSeconds, incorrectSeconds, events)
- ✅ Authentication UI mockup (Admin/Client flows, in-memory)
- ✅ Event logging with timestamps (capped at 100, FIFO with unshift/pop)
- ✅ CSV export functionality (implemented in stats modal)
- ✅ Intelligent feedback system (specific messages per error type)

**What's Broken (❌ Confirmed by Code Audit)**:

- ❌ Desktop notifications (triple IPC bug: method + channel + mechanism)
- ❌ Break reminders (same triple IPC bug)
- ❌ Data persistence across sessions (intentional `resetSession()` wipe on startup)

**Honest Assessment**:

- **Core AI Functionality**: 100% working ✅
- **Notification System**: 0% working ❌ (logic is correct, IPC connection is broken)
- **Data Persistence**: 100% during session, 0% across sessions ⚠️
- **Overall**: ~60% of advertised features functional

The app is **production-ready for posture detection**, but **not production-ready for notifications or historical tracking** until IPC is fixed and session reset is removed/made optional.
