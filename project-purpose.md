# ActiveBreakApp - Project Purpose Document

## üìã Project Overview

**ActiveBreakApp** is a desktop health and wellness application built with Electron that aims to promote better posture and encourage active breaks during prolonged computer use. The application uses real-time computer vision and AI-powered pose detection to monitor user posture and provide timely feedback to prevent ergonomic issues.

## üéØ Intended Purpose

The primary purpose of this application is to:

1. **Monitor User Posture**: Use webcam-based computer vision to detect and analyze user sitting posture in real-time
2. **Promote Healthy Habits**: Alert users when poor posture is detected and encourage periodic active breaks
3. **Track Progress**: Maintain statistics on posture quality over time to help users improve their ergonomic habits
4. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Offer historical data and analytics to help users understand their posture patterns

### Target Audience

- Office workers and remote professionals who spend extended hours at their computers
- Students engaged in long study sessions
- Anyone concerned about preventing musculoskeletal issues related to poor posture
