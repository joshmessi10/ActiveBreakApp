# ActiveBreakApp - Project Purpose Document

## 📋 Project Overview

**ActiveBreakApp** is a desktop health and wellness application built with Electron that aims to promote better posture and encourage active breaks during prolonged computer use. The application uses real-time computer vision and AI-powered pose detection to monitor user posture and provide timely feedback to prevent ergonomic issues.

## 🎯 Intended Purpose

The primary purpose of this application is to:

1. **Monitor User Posture**: Use webcam-based computer vision to detect and analyze user sitting posture in real-time
2. **Promote Healthy Habits**: Alert users when poor posture is detected and encourage periodic active breaks
3. **Track Progress**: Maintain statistics on posture quality over time to help users improve their ergonomic habits
4. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Offer historical data and analytics to help users understand their posture patterns

### Target Audience

### Application Components

1. **Main Process (`main.js`)**

   - Creates application window (1000x700px)
   - Manages application lifecycle
   - Implements security through context isolation and preload scripts
   - **Entry Point**: Loads `public/landing.html` as the initial page
   - **Database Management**: Initializes SQLite3 connection on startup
   - **IPC Handlers**: Implements 5 secure communication channels:
     - `auth:register` - User registration with bcrypt hashing
     - `auth:login` - User authentication with database validation
     - `admin:get-all-users` - Fetch all users for admin dashboard
     - `admin:delete-user` - Delete user by ID from database
     - `notify:posture` - Native OS desktop notifications
   - **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with 10 salt rounds
   - **User Storage**: Persistent database at `data/users.sqlite`

2. **User Interface - Authentication Flow**

   - **Landing Page (`landing.html`)**: App entry point with routing to Admin or Client flows
   - **Admin Flow (`admin/`)**:
     - `admin-login.html`: Admin authentication with database validation
     - `admin-register.html`: Admin registration with bcrypt hashing
     - `admin-welcome.html`: **Fully functional admin dashboard with user management**
       - User table displaying all registered users
       - Client registration button (admins can create client accounts)
       - Settings access button (admin-only configuration)
       - Delete user functionality with IPC backend
       - **Self-deletion detection**: Special warning when admin deletes own account
       - **Immediate logout on self-deletion**: Automatically terminates session and redirects
     - `admin-dashboard.js`: Admin dashboard logic (190 lines)
       - User data fetching via IPC (`admin:get-all-users`)
       - User deletion via IPC (`admin:delete-user`)
       - Self-deletion detection with email matching
       - Dynamic table rendering and message display
       - Logout function using `window.location.replace()` to prevent back-button access
   - **Client Flow (`client/`)**:
     - `client-login.html`: Client authentication with database validation
     - `client-register.html`: Client registration (accessible ONLY from admin dashboard)
     - **Direct redirect to index.html after successful login**
   - **Note**: Authentication is fully functional with SQLite3 database and bcrypt encryption
   - **Important**: Clients CANNOT self-register. Only admins can create client accounts.

3. **User Interface - Core AI Application (Client Area)**

   - **Detection View (`index.html`)**: Real-time camera feed with pose detection overlay and session statistics modal
   - **Settings View (`settings.html`)**: **ADMIN-ONLY** configurable detection sensitivity and notifications
   - **Note**: Statistics are now displayed in a modal within index.html instead of a separate page

4. **Frontend Logic**

   - **`script.js`**: Core AI logic (pose detection, classification, notifications, session statistics modal)
   - **`settings.js`**: Settings management with localStorage persistence
   - Camera access and stream management
   - Session timer functionality

5. **Styling (`style.css`)**
   - Modern dark theme with Inter font and Feather Icons
   - CSS variable design system
   - Responsive layout with micro-interactions
   - Consistent styling across all pages (auth + core app)
